=== Setting up the UI and Terminal

*The workshop was designed and tested on the Chrome browser and it is advised to avoid issues that this browser be used whenever possible*

TIP: For a number of the labs you will be interacting with the OpenShift cluster using a number of different command line tools. In order to avoid you having to install them on your own machine we have taken advantage of the nature of OpenShift and produced a Container that does it all for you, and provides a terminal experience in the browser. In this section you will create that application; this terminal is used throughout the workshop.

NOTE: If you leave the Terminal window open for a long time without using it it will disconnect. To reconnect simply refresh the page.

Open the browser and navigate to the console url {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[{{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}, window="_blank"]

Logon using the user provided by the course administrator ({{USER_ID}})

When logged on you will be presented with a screen listing the projects, of which there are currently none

Hit 'Create Project'

For 'Name' enter terminal-{{USER_ID}}

'Display Name' and 'Description' are optional labels

Once the project has been created (you will be given a dashboard) change the mode of the UI from Administrator to Developer by clicking on the top left of the UI where it says 'Administrator' and selecting 'Developer'

On the Topology page it will state 'No workloads found' - Click on 'From Dockerfile'

In 'Git Repo URL' enter 'https://github.com/marrober/workshop4.git'

Open the advanced Git options by clicking on the blue link "Show Advanced Git Options". 
In the Git Reference field enter 'mainframe' and in the Context Dir field enter '/images/terminal'. 
Change the field 'DockerFile' to have the value 'Dockerfile.390'. 
Leave all other fields as they are and hit 'Create'.

Wait for the ring around the application icon to change to dark blue - this indicates the application has been started. If you want to check the progress of the build operation click on the centre of the application circle in the topology view and then click 'View logs' next to the running build. The build will take a few minutes to complete and will end with the line 'Push successful'.

In the topology page click on the Deployment (the circle with the OpenShift symbol in the centre) and on the right hand side pop out menu right click on the pod name hyperlink. Select the option to open the link in a new browser tab. Click on the terminal menu item and you should see a command line window which will be your terminal for the remainder of the workshop.

Switch back to the UI and click on the {{USER_ID}} displayed at the top right and select 'Copy Login Command' as shown below

In the new tab that appears login with username {{USER_ID}} and password 'openshift'

Click on 'Display Token'

Copy the command given for 'Log in with this token' - this may require using the browser 'copy' command after highlighting the command

Close this tab and switch to the terminal tab - if you have closed the terminal tab go back to the UI repeat the steps indicated above to open the terminal.

Paste and execute the command

Press 'y' to use insecure connections

The terminal should now be logged on - to check it try

oc whoami
oc version

The terminal should display your user for the first command and the client and Kubernetes versions for the second command
